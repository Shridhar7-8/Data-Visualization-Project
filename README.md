# Diabetes Readmission Prediction Project

An end-to-end solution for predicting hospital readmissions for diabetes patients using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting diabetes patient readmissions, including:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluation of predictive models
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualization and monitoring of readmission risks
4. **Resource Allocation**: Recommendations for optimizing healthcare resources

   
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
